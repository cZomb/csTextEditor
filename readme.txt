Java Text Editor

My goal with developing this was to further test GUI design using the Java
Swing library.

Testing using menus and menu items, text fields, and open/save dialog boxes, as
well as file I/O.

Another test was to use menu radiobuttons to change font size of the main
text field.

Goals for the future are to add a completely seperate font window that
allows for unique/precise font sizes, font styles(italic, bold, etc),
various different font types(arial, sans serrif, comic sans, etcetc), being able
to resize the main window and have the scrollbars and text field follow the
new sizing, and having each textfield placed inside a seperate tab panel for the
ability to open many different text files in a single application.

Challenges faced while working on this project were mainly focused around getting
the radiobuttons in the Font Size sub menu to function properly and change the main
text area's font accorrdingly. After some testing I got the feature to work properly
which I will be developing further in future updates.
